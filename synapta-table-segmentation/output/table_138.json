      "SUMMARY 1. Macroeconomic policy aims to maintain the economy near full employment without aggravating\ninflationary pressures. The proper trade-off between these two goals is a source of ongoing debate.\n2. The traditional tools of macroeconomic policy are government spending and tax collection, which\nconstitute fiscal policy, and manipulation of the money supply via monetary policy. Expansion-\nary fiscal policy can stimulate the economy and increase GDP but tends to increase interest rates.\nExpansionary monetary policy works by lowering interest rates.\n3. The business cycle is the economy’s recurring pattern of expansions and recessions. Leading eco-\nnomic indicators can be used to anticipate the evolution of the business cycle because their values\ntend to change before those of other key economic variables.\n4. Industries differ in their sensitivity to the business cycle. More sensitive industries tend to be\nthose producing high-priced durable goods for which the consumer has considerable discretion as\nto the timing of purchase. Examples are jewelry, automobiles, or consumer durables. Other sensi-\ntive industries are those that produce capital equipment for other firms. Operating leverage and\nfinancial leverage increase sensitivity to the business cycle.\n5. Industries generally pass through a predictable life cycle. In the start-up stage, growth is rapid as\na new product begins to permeate the economy, but it is difficult at this point to predict which\nfirms will emerge as industry leaders. As the product becomes established, the industry enters\na consolidation stage and industry leaders begin to emerge. In the maturity stage, the product\nhas largely saturated the market, and further growth merely tracks that of the general economy.\nFinally, the industry enters a stage of relative decline as it faces competition from new products."
