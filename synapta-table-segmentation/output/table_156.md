|  | At times both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s | have used adjustments to these ratings: |
|  | S&P uses plus and minus signs: A+ is the strongest | A rating and A— the weakest. |
|  | Moody’s uses a 1, 2, or 3 designation, with 1 | indicating the strongest. |
|  | AAA Debt rated Aaa and AAA has the | highest rating. Capacity to pay interest |
|  | and principal is extremely strong. |  |
|  | AA Debt rated Aa and AA has a very | strong capacity to pay interest and repay |
|  | principal. Together with the highest | rating, this group comprises the high- |
|  | grade bond class. |  |
|  | Debt rated A has a strong capacity | to pay interest and repay principal, |
|  | although it is somewhat more susceptible | to the adverse effects of |
|  | changes in circumstances and economic | conditions than debt in |
|  | higher-rated categories. |  |
|  | BBB Debt rated Baa and BBB is regarded | as having an adequate capacity to |
|  | pay interest and repay principal. | Whereas it normally exhibits adequate |
|  | protection parameters, adverse | economic conditions or changing |
|  | circumstances are more likely to | lead to a weakened capacity to pay |
|  | interest and repay principal for debt | in this category than in higher-rated |
|  | categories. These bonds are medium-grade | obligations. |
|  | BB Debt rated in these categories is | regarded, on balance, as predominantly |
|  | speculative with respect to capacity | to pay interest and repay principal in |
|  | ccc accordance with the terms of the | obligation. BB and Ba indicate the lowest |
|  | cc degree of speculation, and CC and | Ca the highest degree of speculation. |
|  | Although such debt will likely have | some quality and protective |
|  | characteristics, these are outweighed | by large uncertainties or major risk |
|  | exposures to adverse conditions. | Some issues may be in default. |
|  | This rating is reserved for income | bonds on which no interest is being paid. |
|  | Debt rated D is in default, and payment | of interest and/or repayment of |
|  | principal is in arrears. |  |
