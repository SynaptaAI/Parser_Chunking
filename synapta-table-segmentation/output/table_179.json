Other accounting ratios that have a bearing on a firm’s profitability and/or risk are fixed-asset\nturnover, inventory turnover, days sales in receivables, and the current, quick, and interest cov-\nerage ratios.\n6. Two ratios that make use of the market price of the firm’s common stock in addition to its finan-\ncial statements are the ratios of market to book value and price to earnings.
