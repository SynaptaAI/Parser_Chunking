|  | Investments should offer strong | return potential but with very limited risk. | |
|  | prefer to be conservative and | to minimize losses, even if | miss out on |
|  | substantial growth opportunities. |  |
|  | All nongovernmental investments | should be in industry-leading and |
|  | financially strong companies. |  |
|  | Income needs should be met | entirely through interest income and cash |
|  | dividends. All equity securities | held should pay cash dividends. |
|  | Investment decisions should | be based primarily on consensus forecasts of |
|  | general economic conditions | and company-specific growth. |
|  | If an investment falls below the | purchase price, that security should be |
|  | retained until it returns to its original | cost. Conversely, | prefer to take quick |
|  | profits on successful investments. |  |
|  | | will direct the purchase of investments, | including derivative securities, peri- |
|  | odically. These aggressive investments | result from personal research and |
|  | may not prove consistent with | my investment policy. | have not kept records |
|  | on the performance of similar | past investments, but | have had some “big |
|  | winners.” |  |
